# SUS Pills

Continuation of my project from [Intel AI4YOUTH](https://ai4youth.edu.pl/). The original, full project (without any latest additions) can be found in the [data_misc_sus.7z]() archive.

**The development of this project has been paused for an indefinite amount of time**, or until I decide I'm ready to continue it and find some free time for it.
